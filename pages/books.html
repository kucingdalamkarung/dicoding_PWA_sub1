            Connell and Marianne grow up in the same small town in the west of
            Ireland, but the similarities end there. In school, Connell is
            popular and well-liked, while Marianne is a loner. But when the two
            strike up a conversation - awkward but electrifying - something
            life-changing begins. Normal People is a story of mutual
            fascination, friendship and love. It takes us from that first
            conversation to the years beyond, in the company of two people who
            try to stay apart but find they can't.

              White Fragility : Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About
              Racism

            Anger. Fear. Guilt. Denial. Silence. These are the ways in which
            ordinary white people react when it is pointed out to them that they
            have done or said something that has - unintentionally - caused
            racial offence or hurt. But these reactions only serve to silence
            people of colour, who cannot give honest feedback to 'liberal' white
            people lest they provoke a dangerous emotional reaction. Robin
            DiAngelo coined the term 'White Fragility' in 2011 to describe this
            process and is here to show us how it serves to uphold the system of
            white supremacy. Using knowledge and insight gained over decades of
            running racial awareness workshops and working on this idea as a
            Professor of Whiteness Studies, she shows us how we can start having
            more honest conversations, listen to each other better and react to
            feedback with grace and humility. It is not enough to simply hold
            abstract progressive views and condemn the obvious racists on social
            media - change starts with us all at a practical, granular level,
            and it is time for all white people to take responsibility for
            relinquishing their own racial supremacy. 'With clarity and
            compassion, DiAngelo allows us to understand racism as a practice
            not restricted to "bad people." In doing so, she moves our national
            discussions forward. This is a necessary book for all people
            invested in societal change' Claudia Rankine 'An important book'
            Nikesh Shukla 'By turns mordant and then inspirational, an argument
            that powerful forces and tragic histories stack the deck fully
            against racial justice alongside one that we need only to be
            clearer, try harder, and do better' David Roediger, Los Angeles
            Review of Books 'The value in White Fragility lies in its
            methodical, irrefutable exposure of racism in thought and action,
            and its call for humility and vigilance' Katy Waldman, New Yorker

            that sparked a national conversation. Exploring everything from

            Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a
            development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours
            and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code.
            But it doesn't have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C.
            Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook
            of Agile Software Craftsmanship. Martin has teamed up with his
            colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice
            of cleaning code "on the fly" into a book that will instill within
            you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better
            programmer-but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be
            doing? You'll be reading code-lots of code. And you will be
            challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's
            wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess
            your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean
            Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the
            principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The
            second part consists of several case studies of increasing
            complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code-of
            transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is
            sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter
            containing a list of heuristics and "smells" gathered while creating
            the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the
            way we think when we write, read, and clean code.

            Most new businesses fail. But most of those failures are
            preventable. The Lean Startup is the approach to business that's
            being adopted around the world. It is changing the way companies are
            built and new products are launched. The Lean Startup is about
            learning what your customers really want. It's about testing your
            vision continuously, adapting and adjusting before it's too late.
            Now is the time to think Lean.

            Through a series of recent breakthroughs, deep learning has boosted
            the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know
            close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient
            tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This
            practical book shows you how. By using concrete examples, minimal
            theory, and two production-ready Python frameworks-Scikit-Learn and
            TensorFlow-author Aurelien Geron helps you gain an intuitive
            understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent
            systems. You'll learn a range of techniques, starting with simple
            linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. With
            exercises in each chapter to help you apply what you've learned, all
            you need is programming experience to get started. Explore the
            machine learning landscape, particularly neural nets Use

            Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today.
            Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability,
            consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In
            addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including NoSQL
            datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers. What
            are the right choices for your application? How do you make sense of
            all these buzzwords? In this practical and comprehensive guide,
            author Martin Kleppmann helps you navigate this diverse landscape by
            examining the pros and cons of various technologies for processing
            and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental
            principles remain the same. With this book, software engineers and
            architects will learn how to apply those ideas in practice, and how
            to make full use of data in modern applications. Peer under the hood
            of the systems you already use, and learn how to use and operate
            them more effectively Make informed decisions by identifying the
            strengths and weaknesses of different tools Navigate the trade-offs
            around consistency, scalability, fault tolerance, and complexity
            Understand the distributed systems research upon which modern
            databases are built Peek behind the scenes of major online services,
