            Connell and Marianne grow up in the same small town in the west of
            Ireland, but the similarities end there. In school, Connell is
            popular and well-liked, while Marianne is a loner. But when the two
            strike up a conversation - awkward but electrifying - something
            life-changing begins. Normal People is a story of mutual
            fascination, friendship and love. It takes us from that first
            conversation to the years beyond, in the company of two people who
            try to stay apart but find they can't.

              White Fragility : Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About
              Racism

            Anger. Fear. Guilt. Denial. Silence. These are the ways in which
            ordinary white people react when it is pointed out to them that they
            have done or said something that has - unintentionally - caused
            racial offence or hurt. But these reactions only serve to silence
            people of colour, who cannot give honest feedback to 'liberal' white
            people lest they provoke a dangerous emotional reaction. Robin
            DiAngelo coined the term 'White Fragility' in 2011 to describe this
            process and is here to show us how it serves to uphold the system of
            white supremacy. Using knowledge and insight gained over decades of
            running racial awareness workshops and working on this idea as a
            Professor of Whiteness Studies, she shows us how we can start having
            more honest conversations, listen to each other better and react to
            feedback with grace and humility. It is not enough to simply hold
            abstract progressive views and condemn the obvious racists on social
            media - change starts with us all at a practical, granular level,
            and it is time for all white people to take responsibility for
            relinquishing their own racial supremacy. 'With clarity and
            compassion, DiAngelo allows us to understand racism as a practice
            not restricted to "bad people." In doing so, she moves our national
            discussions forward. This is a necessary book for all people
            invested in societal change' Claudia Rankine 'An important book'
            Nikesh Shukla 'By turns mordant and then inspirational, an argument
            that powerful forces and tragic histories stack the deck fully
            against racial justice alongside one that we need only to be
            clearer, try harder, and do better' David Roediger, Los Angeles
            Review of Books 'The value in White Fragility lies in its
            methodical, irrefutable exposure of racism in thought and action,
            and its call for humility and vigilance' Katy Waldman, New Yorker

            'Every voice raised against racism chips away at its power. We can't
            afford to stay silent. This book is an attempt to speak' The book
            that sparked a national conversation. Exploring everything from
            eradicated black history to the inextricable link between class and
            race, Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race is the
            essential handbook for anyone who wants to understand race relations
            in Britain today.

            From Newcastle to Cornwall, from the birth of the twentieth century
            to the teens of the twenty-first, Girl, Woman, Other follows a cast
            of twelve characters on their personal journeys through this country
            and the last hundred years. They're each looking for something - a
            shared past, an unexpected future, a place to call home, somewhere
            to fit in, a lover, a missed mother, a lost father, even just a
            touch of hope . . . 'Masterful . . . A choral love song to black
            womanhood in modern Great Britain' Elle 'Ambitious, flowing and
